# Mini OS | Mini Operating System
Study project to learn how an operating system works in practice, from resource management to kernel creation, etc. The idea is to create everything from scratch (kernel, graphical interface, etc.) so we have an idea of ​​how it would be done.
<br>
We will start developing the system based on 32 bits, and as we progress we may move to 64 bits. Wish me good luck, because I will need it. All progress will be posted on YouTube, the language will be PTBR.
